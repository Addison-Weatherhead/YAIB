# Yet Another ICU Benchmark
This project aims to provide a unified interface for multiple common ICU prediction endpoints for common ICU datasets. 
We aim to support the following datasets: 
- Amsterdam UMC Database
- HiRID
- MIMIC III/IV
- eICU

For installation details, please check the [legacy readme](README_old.md). 

This file contains documentation on the structure of the project. This is subject to change as we adapt it.
## Directories
A short description of the folders:
- configs: this folder contains subdirectories with GIN configuration files, that specify details about the benchmark tasks
- docs: legacy documents
- files: folder with contents:
  - dataset_stats: some sample data in parquet files (?)
  - fake_data: generated data to demonstrate HiRID benchmark
  - pretrained_weights: weights that have been pre-trained on HiRID data
- icu_benchmarks: top-level package, contains the following:
  - common: package that contains common constants, dataset class, processing code
  - data: package that contains the main preprocessing code, also contains pytorch dataloader
  - endpoints: package that contains detailed endpoint generation code
  - imputation: imputation methods
  - labels: label generation
  - models: main package for the defined models
  - preprocessing: preprocessing package code
  - synthetic_data: package for generating synthetic data
- preprocessing: (?)
- run_scripts: lots of shell scripts for previous paper experiments (?)
- tests: testing package

## Libraries
We currently use the following libraries:
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
    - An open source machine learning framework for 
- [Pytorch Ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite)
    - Library for training and evaluating neural networks in Pytorch
- [GIN](https://github.com/google/gin-config)
    - Gin provides a lightweight configuration framework for Python
- [Pathos](https://pathos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - Parallel computing framework, used for preprocessing

# CLI Commands

## Preprocess and Train

```
